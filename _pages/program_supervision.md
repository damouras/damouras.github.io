## Statistics Specialist Program Supervision 
- How programs of study work at UofT 

- *I want/need to take a course but I don't have the prerequisitesl; can you let me take the course?*
	+ Program supervisors *cannot* waive course prerequisites (they can only waive program requirements). At UTSC, only the instructor of a course has the final say on who gets to take the course (in the sense that he/she can remove you from the course without notice if you do not have the prerequisites or his/her explicit consent). Program supervisors can only give waivers for program requirements, but these do not automatically translate to prerequisite waivers.
- *The program requires me to take a course but I already have an exclusion to that course; can/should I still take it?* 
  	+ Yes, you can/should still take XYZ as an extra course. Extra courses are like regular courses, with the exception that they do not carry credit and their mark is not included in your GPA calculation (the rational behind this is that you should not earn credit or improve you marks from taking courses on similar topics, even if they are at different levels). Extra courses can still count towards satisfying course prerequisites & program requirements, and your grade in them will still appear on your transcript.
